# System-wide Crypto policy:
# This system is following system-wide crypto policy. The changes to
# Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgoritms and GSSAPIKexAlgorithsm will not have any
# effect here. They will be overridden by command-line options passed on
# the server start up.
# To opt out, uncomment a line with redefinition of  CRYPTO_POLICY=
# variable in  /etc/sysconfig/sshd  to overwrite the policy.
